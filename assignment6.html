	<h1>49ers</h1>
    <p>The 49ers are my favorite team. I am looking forward to the 2022/2023 football season with Trey Lance starting at QB for our team. I am hoping that we will end our drought of over 25 years and finally win another championship. I am <b>extremely excited</b> for this next season to officially be underway! Go niners.</p>
    <p>I am creating a link to 
    <a href="https://www.49ers.com/">the 49ers homepage</a>, which will provide more information about the team.
